                <p1>MY INTERESTS</p1>
                <p><strong>I am deeply interested in technology and computer science. I enjoy creating programs and
                        algorithms that help solve a problem. I love learning new tools and concepts that enhance my
                        skills. In addition, I am deeply interested in history and frequently watch documentaries.
                        Farthermore, I love sports especially cricket and basketball. My favorite cricket team is
                        of-course Cricket and I support my hometown New York Knicks in Basketball. Lastly, I enjoy
                        watching retro-movies and TV Shows. Currently, I am watching the classic sitcom
                        Friends.</strong></p>
